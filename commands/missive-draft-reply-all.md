allowed-tools: mcp__missive__missive_conversations, mcp__missive__missive_messages, mcp__missive__missive_drafts
---

Review my Missive inbox and create draft replies for all conversations that need responses.

## What to Draft
- Direct questions requiring my response
- Action requests
- Follow-ups on previous conversations
- Introduction emails from new contacts
- Client/customer messages

## What to Skip
- Newsletters and marketing emails
- Automated notifications
- No-reply addresses
- Already replied threads
- Receipts and confirmations

## Rules
1. **Reply-All**: Include all original recipients
2. **Match Sender**: Reply from the email address it was sent TO
3. **Brief**: 2-4 sentences unless more detail is needed
4. **Never Send**: Only create drafts - I will review first

Summarize: conversations reviewed, drafts created, any needing special attention.
