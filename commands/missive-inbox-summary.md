description: Show summary of open Missive conversations needing attention
---

List my open Missive conversations and categorize them:

1. **Needs Response**: Conversations where I'm the last one who needs to reply
2. **Waiting**: Conversations where I'm waiting for someone else's reply
3. **FYI Only**: Newsletters, notifications, and informational emails

For each conversation needing response, show:
- Subject
- From (sender name/email)
- How long ago received
- Brief preview of what they're asking

Don't create any drafts - just give me the overview so I can decide what to tackle.
