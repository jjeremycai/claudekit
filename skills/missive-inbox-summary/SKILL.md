description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "check inbox", "show emails", "what needs response", "inbox summary", "review messages", or wants to see a summary of open Missive conversations needing attention.
---

List open Missive conversations and categorize them:

1. **Needs Response**: Conversations where the user needs to reply
2. **Waiting**: Conversations waiting for someone else's reply
3. **FYI Only**: Newsletters, notifications, and informational emails

For each conversation needing response, show:
- Subject
- From (sender name/email)
- How long ago received
- Brief preview of what they're asking

Don't create any drafts - just give the overview so the user can decide what to tackle.
